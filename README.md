# Convert Text Type

**Convert Text Type** is a simple Illustrator script to convert _Point text_ to _Area text_ and vice versa. Adobe Illustrator CC has this feature built in, so this script is mostly for versions CS6 and below.

## Installation

Place "Convert Text Type.js" into the following folder:

**Windows**: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [version]\Presets\Scripts<br>
**Mac**: Applications/Adobe Illustrator [version]/Presets/Scripts

Note: Depending on the application version and language, folder names may be localized and the path may also include a region directory, e.g.

**CS5, Windows**: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS5\Presets\en_US\Scripts<br>
**CS6, Mac, German**: Programme/Adobe Illustrator CS6/Vorgaben/de_DE/Skripten

## Compatibility

**Adobe Illustrator CS6, CS5, CS4, CS3**

Versions CS2 and below have not been tested yet, but the script should work just fine. If you were able to run it, please let me know so I can add it to the list.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to contact me.
